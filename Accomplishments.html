            <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
            <p>The New York Giants have one of the best resumes in the National Football League. Their overall record is 721-649-34. Their playoff record isnâ€™t so hot at 25-26.Although, they are 4-1 in their super bowl appearances. They won four super bowls, in the years: 1987,1991,2008, and 2012. In their first two super bowl victories, they defeated the Denver Broncos and the Buffalo Bills. </p>

            <p>In 2008 and 2012, they took down arguably the greatest quarterback of all-time, Tom Brady.In that 2008 season, the Patriots were 18-0 going into the super bowl. Somehow the Giants managed to go into the game and pull off an upset to remember in the NFL.</p>
